**Adj_100day.mat** - weighted adjacency matrix of 250 ground-targets, 84 satellites, and 77 ground stations where connections are weighted by contact time. Except for ground station to satellite contacts where the contact time is divided by the number of satellites in view of the same ground station at the same time step.

**Adj_100day_random.mat** - weighted adjacency matrix for a randomly generated selection of 300 ground-targets and 100 spacecraft, alongside 77 existing ground station sites where connections are weighted by contact time. 

**rand_5src_20sat_10GS.mat** - 100 randomly generated cases with 10 ground station selected for 5 sources (targets) and 20 spacecraft.

**rand_20src_40sat_10GS.mat** - 100 randomly generated cases with 10 ground station selected for 20 sources (targets) and 40 spacecraft.

**rand_40src_10sat_10GS.mat** - 100 randomly generated cases with 10 ground station selected for 40 sources (targets) and 10 spacecraft.
